        <h1>Donate to my work</h1>
        <p>
          There are a lot of costs associated with web development. There are server costs to worry
          about, domain subscription costs (usually around $13 a year but my portfolio domain costs
          $40 a year to renew) and, of course, the time it take for me to build these pages. Some
          are more difficult than others, some take more time than others, and I currently spend
          around 60 hours a week building and maintaining these pages. Every dollar donated is
          considered carefully as to what costs it should go towards. Personal projects are costly
          as often I don't build any form of compensation into them. I'm a large opponent to ads, as
          they take up a lot of data and often make websites look terrible. I often find myself
          thinking and working about problems that are public issues and should be open-source and
          free to anyone with the desire to use them. I rely heavily on donations and client
          contracts to fund my career as a web developer, so please consider even just a dollar or
          two to help me along my way. This is a burgeoning industry I'm excited to be a part of and
          eternally grateful for any support whatsoever.

          You can contact me at my email address, jordanwbutterwick@gmail.com for any contract work,
          give me advice or a compliment, ask questions, and the like. Please consider a patreon
          subscription as it's the best way for me to fund my work.
