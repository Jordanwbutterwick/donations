        <h1>Donate to my work</h1>
        <p>
          There are a lot of costs associated with web development. There are
          server costs to worry about, domain subscription costs (usually around
          $13 a year but my portfolio domain costs $40 a year to renew) and, of
          course, the time it take for me to build these pages. Some are more
          difficult than others, some take more time than others, and I
          currently spend around 60 hours a week building and maintaining these
          pages. Every dollar donated is considered carefully as to what costs
          it should go towards. Personal projects are costly as often I don't
          build any form of compensation into them. I'm a large opponent to ads,
          as they take up a lot of data and often make websites look terrible. I
          often find myself thinking and working about problems that are public
          issues and should be open-source and free to anyone with the desire to
          use them. I rely heavily on donations and client contracts to fund my
          career as a web developer, so please consider even just a dollar or
          two to help me along my way. This is a burgeoning industry I'm excited
          to be a part of and eternally grateful for any support whatsoever.

          You can contact me at my email address, jordanwbutterwick@gmail.com
          for any contract work, give me advice or a compliment, ask questions,
          and the like. Please consider a patreon subscription as it's the best
          way for me to fund my work.

          Below you will find links to paypal and patreon to donate to. I don't
          want to be pushy so I'll end my monologue here.
        </p>
        <p>
          Thank you for your consideration and support. I truly love this
          career.
